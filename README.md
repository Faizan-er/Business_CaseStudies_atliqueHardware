#### AtliQ Hardware, headquartered in Delhi, supplies computer hardware and peripherals to clients across India, including Surge Stores, Nomad Stores, Excel Stores, and Electronicalsara Stores. The Sales Director faces challenges in tracking sales performance due to declining overall sales and reliance on verbal communication with regional managers. This approach lacks concrete evidence and leads to disjointed information primarily through Excel files. To address this, a structured approach was implemented:

1. Data Gathering: Sales data from various sources, including Excel files and MySQL databases, was consolidated.

2. Data Exploration: Thorough examination of collected data identified key variables and addressed data quality issues.

3. Data Transformation and Modeling: Data was preprocessed and transformed to create a unified dataset, facilitating analysis and visualization.

4. Dashboard Development: Power BI was used to develop an interactive sales analysis dashboard, providing a comprehensive view of sales performance across regions.

5. Insights and Recommendations: Analysis of sales data revealed insights into factors contributing to declining sales, enabling actionable recommendations for business growth.

Technologies Used:

MySQL: Storing and retrieving sales data.
Power BI: Data exploration, modeling, and dashboard development, offering interactive visualizations and insights.
